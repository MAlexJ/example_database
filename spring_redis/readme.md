Redis can be used in various ways, including:

1) In-Memory Database: In todayâ€™s data-driven world, handling vast amounts of real-time data is a common challenge for
   businesses. A real-time database is a type of data repository designed to acquire, analyze, and/or augment an
   incoming stream of data points in real time, often immediately after the data is produced. Redis may be used to build
   data infrastructure for real-time applications that need high throughput and low latency.
2) Cache: Many applications struggle with the need to store and retrieve data quickly, especially in systems with high
   latency. Due to its speed, Redis is the ideal choice for caching API calls, session states, complex computations, and
   database queries.
3) Message Broker (MQ): It has always been difficult to stream data around the organization and make it accessible for
   various system components. Redis supports messaging, event sources, alerts, and high-speed data intake using its
   stream data type.
