### Spring Data JPA One-To-One Bidirectional Relationship

A Spring Data JPA bidirectional one-to-one relationship means that both entities are aware of each other
and can navigate the relationship from either side.
In other words, in a bidirectional relationship we can fetch information about two related entities
by querying each one separately.
Thus, we can move from one entity to another and vice versa.
