#### One-to-many Bidirectional relationship

In Spring Data JPA, a bidirectional one-to-many relationship involves two entities where one entity
has a collection that holds multiple instances of another entity.
This relationship is bidirectional, meaning that each entity is aware of its relationship with the other.
